 * Everything about this app's identity that the shared app shell reads: its
 * name and descriptions, its colours, what search engines may crawl, what the
 * installed app offers, and the wording of the not-found and error pages. The
 * shell files (`layout.tsx`, `_metadata.ts`, `manifest.ts`, `robots.ts`,
 * `sitemap.ts`, `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`) are the same
 * in every app, and this file is where they differ. It keeps the same export
 * names in every app, and holds values only: no components, no side effects.
